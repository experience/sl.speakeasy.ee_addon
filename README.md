## An Important Note About Support

Speakeasy (in common with all of my ExpressionEngine add-ons) is no longer officially supported.

Check out the wiki for [installation and usage instructions][wiki], and feel free to fork the repo if you'd like to make some changes or improvements (it's distributed under a liberal open source license).

Hopefully this will be everything you need to use this add-on in your projects, but if not please don't email me asking for support; I don't even have ExpressionEngine installed locally any more.

## Overview

Speakeasy is an ExpressionEngine add-on which makes it easy for your visitors to self-moderate their comments, keeping the conversation flowing whilst defending against spam bots.
